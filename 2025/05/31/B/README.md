# Crypto Trading Isn't 'Gambling': The Luck Can Be Owned
Crypto trading is often presented like slot machines or roulette wheels. _"Anyone can get rich quick!"_ the hype screams, while conveniently ignoring volatility, regulation and basic economics.

## Acknowledging The Gamble
Yes, there are similarities to traditional forms of betting, such as the Low Barrier of Entry; millions are not needed; a few hundred bucks can do in the ring, trading volatile assets with potentially high payouts, or massive losses.

Another similarity is that it often feels like placing a bet. _"I'll buy this coin because I feel it's going to pump!"_ or based on hearsay _"Hey Reddit! Heard $DOG token is hot today!"_ rather than by the result of a rigorous analysis. 

There's the High Risk/Reward similarity. The potential for outsized gains mirrors the high stakes involved in gambling. And just like in Vegas, bets are likely going to go against someone else while hoping for luck to hold.

## Crypto Trading Is Different
Okay yes, it looks and feels identical to a gamble from an outsider's perspective, or when done by beginners who haven't internalized the risks yet. But, here’s where things get interesting. Crypto trading isn’t fundamentally gambling, because traders have choices. Every single time a trading application is opened, traders can choose the path, even if is to high frequency trade $XRP on a tip or hold it forever.

## Risk Is Not Written In Stone
The risk level can always be chosen. For instance, if the trade is with leverage, the ratio and the time to hold the position are variables that can be set by the trader. The same goes for the trading method, which can be, for example, only spot buying using stablecoins like USDT as temporary holding place until market conditions change, or maybe it's about the first ten bucks crypto trading decision, based purely on a gut feeling or an anonymous tip that bypassed any actual research, case on which the product of that kind of trade would be gambling.

But if some basic homework is performed, even if flawed and incomplete work, even just reading up briefly about what the coin actually does, who its developers are, or lack thereof, recent news flow impacting it specifically right now, then the trader owns the luck. This isn't a passive thing. "Owning the luck" means consciously deciding how much risk traders are willing to take and, above all, why.

## Conscious Risk Management
Caution can't just be thrown out the window because crypto looks risky or volatile. —Which it is. Instead, maybe that volatility can be part of a strategy. Maybe the percentage loss can be decided so a threshold triggers an automatic stop-loss order. 

Or, perhaps, leverage can be understood as something that isn't for beginners, hence the choice to trade without using borrowed money at all until the understanding deepens significantly would constitute a wise choice.

## Making Informed Decisions
The trader might not be as skilled as Warren Buffett analyzing P/E ratios, but maybe did check if there were any major security breaches on the exchange last month before depositing funds. Maybe a few different opinions were read, not just one pump-and-dump promoter's view.

## Taking Personal Responsibility
Luck isn't something to be wished upon or blamed for when things go wrong. The decision about how much of the hard-earned cash is on the line, what assets are involved and under which conditions, all come down to the trader's will.

## What's the catch?
Here’s a crucial point. "Owning" doesn’t mean success can be guaranteed. The market will still throw curveballs designed to make even experienced traders lose sleep. 

The strategy might be fundamentally weak. Maybe just buying $BTC because it's the big dog isn't actually smart risk management if $BTC itself is crashing due to macroeconomic factors beyond the trader's control. But here’s what "owning" does. It stops being a victim mentality. If traders gamble blindly and get wiped out, someone else might say _"Well they were just lucky before the third week"_. But that's not true anymore, because now their luck has run dry on the first bet.

If the risk is consciously assessed by traders, even if it’s simply the risk acknowledgment that makes the trade so risky that leverage is avoided, or make a decision based partly, however flawedly or based on incomplete the research, then it's no-longer just gambling, but rather an informed choice.

## Buttom Line
Crypto trading isn't inherently 'gambling' because unlike pulling the levers at random in Las Vegas, where the house always wins long-term statistically, in crypto there are the traders that choose what to bet on and how much risk is involved.

Luck can be owned by making conscious, even if imperfectly informed decisions. It doesn’t mean the trader will win every time or that success isn't hard-won, but it means failure stops being a statistical inevitability for those who just haven‘t done anything yet.

The blaming of the volatility must be stopped and owned. What happens next when the chosen asset moves against the established plan, is not because of some cosmic casino mumbo jumbo, but rather the result of a well known process.
